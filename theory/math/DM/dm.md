Stirling's Formula

```
n! ∼ sqrt(2*π*n) * (n/e)^n
```

distributing n presents to k kids, the number of ways:
n = n1 + n2 + ... + nk

```
n!/(n1!n2!...nk!)
```

the number of ways to distribute n identical pennies to k children, so that each child gets at least on, is

```
C(n-1, k-1)
```


C(n,  k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)
