goal: construct and read mathematical proofs.

proof: 
(1) deduction, derivation
(2) a set of hypotheses (premises, axioms)
(3) proof templates (logical rules)

prove statements

atomic compund

logical connectives: implication (if-then), conjunction(and), disjunction(or), negation(not), and (existential or universal) quantifiers

compound statements are defined as follows: If P and Q are statements, then

1. the conjunction of P and Q is denoted P ^ Q (pronounced, P and Q)

2. the disjunction of P and Q is denoted P V Q (pronounced, P or Q)

3. the implication of P and Q is denoted P => Q (pronounced, if P then Q, or P implies Q)
